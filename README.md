# Depression Progression among Medical Students: A Longitudinal Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze mental health trends in medical students over time, focusing on the progression and fluctuations of depression states. The study uses data from the ETMED-L project, which tracks mental health indicators in medical students at the University of Lausanne through three waves (March 2021, November 2021, November 2022).

## Dataset

The dataset includes responses from 1,595 medical students and captures multiple aspects of mental health, such as:

- **Depression symptoms** (CES-D)
- **Anxiety symptoms** (STAI)
- **Burnout indicators** (MBI-SS)

In addition, the dataset includes biopsychosocial variables, including gender identity, social support, physical activity, satisfaction with health, and coping strategies.

## Objectives

1. **Model Mental Health Transitions**: Use a Hidden Markov Model to model the changes in depression states (e.g., low, moderate, severe) over time, with a goal of understanding equilibrium states and trends in mental health.
   
2. **Regression**: Apply multiple regression to study the non-linear trend in mental health.
